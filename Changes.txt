Changes:

-Created Classes, Interfaces & Variables folders for clean file structure

-Implemented Interfaces and referred to Interfaces throughout the project instead of Class names

-Fixed GraduationTracker.HasGraduated() method
There was an incorrect code  which was always returning "Remedial".
-Fixed code in which "SUMACUMLAUDE" wasnt getting considered. 
-Condition to check "Average" and return standing was  fixed to consider multiple ranges from 50-95. 
- Implemented break; to break from for loop and used Equals() instead of == for value check.

-Used LinQ instead of For Loops in Repository.cs

-Added 3 new tests for Repository Class methods in a new Test Class

-Added new test case for GraduationTracker to test negative scenario for the user who has not graduated

- The Test happens on whether the Diploma is False or True and not on Any()

- Variable initialization code was added into a different method using [ClassInitialize] and cleanup code was added to method marked as [ClassCleanup].
